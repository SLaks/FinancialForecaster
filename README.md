# FinancialForecaster

FinancialForecaster is a simple tool for financial forecasting.  You can input a mortgage, general income / expenses, and checking / savings account details / rates, and it will forecast growth over time.

## Usage

Enter all inputs in the tabs on the top left.  They will be saved in the URL as you type, so you can clone the browser tab to compare different forecasts.

## Upcoming features

I may or may not implement these:

 - Unit tests
 - Model retirement funds / income tax
 - Save / load data from localStorage
 - Save / load data from Google Sheets
 - Add presets for the expenses table
 - Emoji dropdown for expense names
